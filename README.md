<i>Give Cat is an attempt to bring happiness and joy to everyday life... One cat at a time.</i>

At the click of a button or the touch of a screen you can turn every image on a website into a picture of a cute cat!

### How can I get involved?

I've got a list of enhancements that can be found on the <a href="http://github.com/mattrayner/Give.Cat/issues/">issues page</a>, they range form outstanding questions about device compatabilities to bugs and enhancements.

The best way to get involved is just to pull a fork and make some changes! I'm up for any improvements / features you've got.

##### Credit where credit's due

I've got to give credit for the original idea to <a href="http://heygirl.io">HeyGirl.io</a>, I took this original Ryan Gosling idea and morphed it into cats... Then I went a bit overboard and it became what you see here!

I use a couple of libraries in here too:

* <a href="https://gist.github.com/miguelxt/908143">SimpleImage - PHP Library</a>
